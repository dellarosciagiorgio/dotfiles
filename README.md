# **linux dotfiles** (_wip_)

these are my dotfiles that i use on linux. they are based on a basic style, this is due to two factors:
1. i like a minimal look;
1. i really can't do more complicated things.

here's a list of software i'm customizing, it's a work in progress so not all boxes are checked:
+ [ ] bspwm
+ [x] <u>flameshot</u>
+ [x] kitty
+ [x] neofetch
+ [ ] polybar
+ [x] rofi
+ [ ] sxhkd

i also added some wallpapers: some are mine, many others are not.
